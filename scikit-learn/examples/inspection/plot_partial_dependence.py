Partial Dependence and Individual Conditional Expectation Plots
===============================================================

Partial dependence plots show the dependence between the target function [2]_
and a set of features of interest, marginalizing over the values of all other
features (the complement features). Due to the limits of human perception, the
size of the set of features of interest must be small (usually, one or two)
thus they are usually chosen among the most important features.

Similarly, an individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot [3]_
shows the dependence between the target function and a feature of interest.
However, unlike partial dependence plots, which show the average effect of the
features of interest, ICE plots visualize the dependence of the prediction on a
feature for each :term:`sample` separately, with one line per sample.
Only one feature of interest is supported for ICE plots.

This example shows how to obtain partial dependence and ICE plots from a
:class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` and a
:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` trained on the
California housing dataset. The example is taken from [1]_.

# We configured a pipeline to scale the numerical input features and tuned the
# neural network size and learning rate to get a reasonable compromise between
# training time and predictive performance on a test set.
#
# Importantly, this tabular dataset has very different dynamic ranges for its
# features. Neural networks tend to be very sensitive to features with varying
# scales and forgetting to preprocess the numeric feature would lead to a very
# poor model.
#
# It would be possible to get even higher predictive performance with a larger
# neural network but the training would also be significantly more expensive.
#
# Note that it is important to check that the model is accurate enough on a
# test set before plotting the partial dependence since there would be little
# use in explaining the impact of a given feature on the prediction function of
# a poor model.
#
# We will plot the partial dependence, both individual (ICE) and averaged one
# (PDP). We limit to only 50 ICE curves to not overcrowd the plot.

# Analysis of the plots
# .....................
#
# We can clearly see on the PDPs (thick blue line) that the median house price
# shows a linear relationship with the median income (top left) and that the
# house price drops when the average occupants per household increases (top
# middle). The top right plot shows that the house age in a district does not
# have a strong influence on the (median) house price; so does the average
# rooms per household.
#
# The ICE curves (light blue lines) complement the analysis: we can see that
# there are some exceptions, where the house price remain constant with median
# income and average occupants. On the other hand, while the house age (top
# right) does not have a strong influence on the median house price on average,
# there seems to be a number of exceptions where the house price increase when
# between the ages 15-25. Similar exceptions can be observed for the average
# number of rooms (bottom left). Therefore, ICE plots show some individual
# effect which are attenuated by taking the averages.
#
# In all plots, the tick marks on the x-axis represent the deciles of the
# feature values in the training data.
#
# We also observe that :class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` has much
# smoother predictions than
# :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.
#
# However, it is worth noting that we are creating potential meaningless
# synthetic samples if features are correlated.

# %%
# 2D interaction plots
# --------------------
#
# PDPs with two features of interest enable us to visualize interactions among
# them. However, ICEs cannot be plotted in an easy manner and thus interpreted.
# Another consideration is linked to the performance to compute the PDPs. With
# the tree-based algorithm, when only PDPs are requested, they can be computed
# on an efficient way using the `'recursion'` method.
